This is where I keep a record of my fairly random research and experiments.

Feel free to use any of it in any context, personal or to make money. I don't mind,
but I can't guarantee anything, so use them at your own risk.

Also, feel free to open issues or create pull requests if you have any questions
or suggestions.

Have fun.
