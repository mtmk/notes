Classes and Scope
-----------------

Classes have constructors and destructors. Constructors
look like methods that have the same name as the class.
They run when the class if first instantiated, which means
allocated in memory. In contrast destructors are run when
the object (the instance of the class) is removed from
memory, in our case when it goes out of scope.
